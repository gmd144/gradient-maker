# Gradient Maker

This is a simple project that generates a random linear gradient each time you
- refreseh the page
- press the space button on keyboard
- click the generate button

You can also click on each color that toggles a color picker and you can create a gradient for yourself. It also displays the color HEX values below them so you can generate the same gradient using these values in any other app.
